    "1. For problem 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, please write all of your solutions in this file using ***Markdown***, of which the syntax can be found with [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#ordered-lists).\n",
    "2. For the programming problem, problem 6, please finish it as required in this file, `HW4.ipynb`.\n",
    "3. Please upload the completed `.ipynb` file with the filename as `HW4\\_studentID.ipynb` to **[i-school(Plus)](https://istudy.ntut.edu.tw/learn/index.php)**.\n",
    "4. **Late work** is not acceptable. Remember, the ***deadline*** is the midnight of **Jun 7, 2021**.\n",
    "5. Honest Policy: We encourage students to discuss their work with the peer. However, each student should write the program, or the problem solutions on her/his own. Those who copy others' work will get 0 on the homework grade.\n",
